# Tips to Learn Machine Learning

Machine Learning is one of the hottest topic in Tech Industries now a days. Lots of software professionals started learning ML, may be as part of internal training or self-study. I am also started this journey few months back and below are my suggestions to start this journey for any new starts like me.

First find a good tutorials and start learning the Machine learning by some easy steps. Don't start learning with difficult topic or subject, instead start with very easy and toy example (like Iris Dataset). Understand the code and concepts, later move to some difficult topics. Also you can take any Udemy online courses and make sure to practice the code and example explained in that course by your own.

Below are list of things you need to start working on:

1) Python (Pandas, numpy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tensorflow )
2) Maths (Basic Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability, Statics)
3) Actual Machine learning algorithms and models
4) Hands on Project in ML (use the Kaggle dataset)
5) Participate in Hackathons or Kaggle competition.

Hope this will help you. Thanks!
